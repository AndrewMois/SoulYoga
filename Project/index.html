                    <p>Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose

                    <p>Research shows that a consistent bedtime yoga routine can help you get in the right mindset and

                    <p>Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and improving mobility in people with lower
                        back pain. The American College of Physicians recommends yoga as a first-line treatment for
                        chronic low back pain.</p>

                    <p>According to the National Institutes of Health, scientific evidence shows that yoga supports
                        stress management, mental health, mindfulness, healthy eating, weight loss and quality sleep.

            <h2>Greater self control</h2>
            <p>There are so many different types of yoga. Right now, the only things which are in your experience are
                your body, your mind, and your emotions.</p>
            <p>You know them to some extent, and you can infer that if these three things have to happen the way they
                are happening, there must be an energy that makes them happen.</p>

            <h2>Our studio</h2>
            <p>We are an astanga yoga school that tries to teach in a traditional way so students can progress at their
                own pace. We offer quality, compassionate teaching. We try to ensure everyone feels welcome as we feel
                the idea of a supportive community is very important. We usually work with hands-on adjustments: if you
                feel uncomfortable with this, just let us know: no questions or judgement.</p>
            <p>Our shala is named 'Dharma Shala' inspired by the story of an ancient Indian king called Ashoka who built
                many 'dharma shalas' to support wandering yogis. We hope our dharma shala will be a supportive place for
                you.</p>
